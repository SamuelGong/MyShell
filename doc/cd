cd:

    cd [directory]

    Change the current directory to the designated directory. If no directory is designated, then the default directory is the home directory.

    If the path includes the home directory, the whole path of the home directory will can be replaced by a symbol '~'.    

    For example, you may use " cd ~/myshell " to change the current working directory from some place like " /etc " to " ~/myshell "
