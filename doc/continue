continue:

    continue

    Continue the while loop, which begins with the test commands.

    For example, if you have such statements in your batch file:

    ...
    i=0
    set I do not love Linux
    while test i -lt 5
    do
        if test i -eq 2
        then
            continue
        fi
        echo $1
        shift
    done

    Then you will obtain "I" "do" "love" "Linux" on the screen, where each word is occupying a line, but "not" will not appear since the continue command works.
