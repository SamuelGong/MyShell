bg:

    bg [num]

    Run the selected job which stopped in the background, in the background.

    For example, given the job list below ( obtained by " jobs "), you can run the job " sleep 100 " in the background by " bg 1".

         [1]     stopped		sleep 100
         [2]-    running		sleep 300 &
         [3]+    stopped		sleep 200

    If no job is designated, then the one with '+' will be the object.

    For example, you can run the job " sleep 200 " in the background by the command " bg ".

    If there are no background jobs at all, then it will do nothing.
