umask:

    umask [mask]

    Displaying the file mode creation mask (umask) , or setting the umask to [mask] & 0777.

    For example, " umask " can result in a umask like "0022" on your screen.

    If output is redirected, then the procedure will write the result into the designated destination. 

    For example, " umask | wc -w ", " umask > a.txt ", " umask >> b.txt " are all supported.

    If an octal mask is appended, then the umask will be changed into that umask bitwised-and by 0777, where no output at all.

    For example, " umask 0666 " will change the umask in myshell into 0666.
