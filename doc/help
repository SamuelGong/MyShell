help:

    help [command]

    Write the helping manual to the standard output.

    For example, you can obtain the manual of " echo " by " help echo ".

    Only the commands myshell implemented have a manual.

    If there is no command designated, then a general manual will be shown.

    If output is redirected, then the procedure will write the result into the designated destination. 

    For example, " help time | more ", " help environ > a.txt ", " help bg >> b.txt " are all supported.
