fg:

    fg [num]

    Run the selected job in the foreground. The job should be background one before execute the command.

    For example, given the job list below ( obtained by " jobs "), you can run the job " sleep 300 " in the foreground by " fg 2".

         [1]     stopped		sleep 100
         [2]-    running		sleep 300 &
         [3]+    stopped		sleep 200

    If no job is designated, then the one with '+' will be the object.

    For example, you can run the job " sleep 200 " in the foreground by the command " fg ".

    If there are no background jobs at all, then it will do nothing.
