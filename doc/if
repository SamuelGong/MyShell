if:

    if test [expression]
    then
        [A commands]
    fi
    [B commands]

    Execute the command according to condition.

    If the exit status of expression is true (0), then [A commands] will be executed before [B commands] being executed, otherwise [A commands] will be skipped.

    For example, if you have such statements in your batch file:

    ...
    $i=0
    if test $i -eq 0
    then
        $i=100
    fi
    $i=i+1

    After executing this segments of codes, you will have $i = 101.
