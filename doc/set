set:

    set [arguments]

    If no arguments are designated, this command will result in a display of the list of all the local shell variables.

    The format is like :

    ...
    a=A
    b=C
    ...

    If output is redirected, then the procedure will write the result into the designated destination. 

    For example, " set | wc -l ", " set > a.txt ", " set >> b.txt " are all supported.

    If there are arguments, then they will be assigned to the positional variables from $1 to $9.

    For example, you can set $1 and $2 to be "Love" and "Linux" respectively by the command " set Love Linux ".

    Locational variables, local shell variables and environment variables are also supported.

    For example, you can use " set $HOME " to set the $1 to be the value of the environment variable named HOME.
