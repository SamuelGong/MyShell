pwd:

    pwd

    Write the path of the current working directory to the standard output with a newline appended.

    If the path includes the home directory, the whole path of the home directory will be replaced by a symbol '~'.

    For example, if you are now in the directory "/home/ji/myshell/", and your home directory is "/home/ji/", then you will otain "~/myshell" if you execute the command.

    If output is redirected, then the procedure will write the result into the designated destination. 

    For example, " pwd | wc -c ", " pwd > a.txt " , " pwd >> b.txt " are all supported.
