test:

    test [expression]

    Evalute the conditional expression. Exit with code 0 if that expression is true, and 1 otherwise.

    1. For string expression:
    
        -z STRING                 True if string is empty.
    
        -n STRING                 True if string is not empty.
    
        STRING1 = STRING2         True if the strings are equal.

        STRING1 != STRING2        True if the strings are not equal.

    2. For integer expression:

        INT1 -eq INT2           True if the integers are equal.

        INT1 -ne INT2           True if the integers are not equal.

       	INT1 -gt INT2           True if the former is greater than the latter.

        INT1 -ge INT2           True if the former is greater than or equal to the latter.

        INT1 -lt INT2           True if the former is less than the latter.

        INT1 -le INT2           True if the former is greater than or equal to the latter.

    In all the above expression, locational variables, local shell variables and environment variables are also supported.

    For example, you can use $0, $1, ..., $9, $$, $@, $#, $?, $!, $*, $a (assume that it is one of the local shell variables), $HOME ...

    3. For file test:

      -d FILE                   True if file is a directory.

      -e FILE                   True if file exists.

      -f FILE                   True if file exists and is a regular file.

      -g FILE                   True if file is set-group-id.

      -r FILE                   True if file is readable by you.

      -s FILE                   True if file exists and is not empty.

      -u FILE                   True if the file is set-user-id.

      -w FILE                   True if the file is writable by you.

      -x FILE                   True if the file is executable by you.
