dir:

    dir [directory]

    Write the list of all the directories and files in the designated directory to the standard output with a newline appended.

    If the path includes the home directory, the whole path of the home directory will can be replaced by a symbol '~'.

    For example, you may get a list by " dir ~/myC/doc " like this:

        general.txt        dir.txt       time.txt
                  .            clr        pwd.txt
          umask.txt       quit.txt       echo.txt
         readme.txt             ..        clr.txt

    If there is not a path designated, i.e. just " dir ", then the content of the current working directory will be obtained.

    If output is redirected, then the procedure will write the result into the designated destination. 

    For example, " dir | wc -w ", " dir > a.txt ", " pwd >> b.txt " are all supported.
