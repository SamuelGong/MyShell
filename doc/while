while:

    while test [expression]
    do
        [A commands]
    done
    [B commands]

    Executing A commands as long as the test result of expression is true (0), otherwise B commands will be executed sequentially.

    For example, if you have such statements in your batch file:

    ...
    i=0
    while test $i -lt 3
    do
        i=$i+1
    done
    echo $i

    Then you will obtain "3" on the screen after executing that segment of codes.
