jobs:

    jobs

    Write all the background jobs to the standard output with a newline appended. The format is like :

    [num]( /-/+)    status    <all the arguments of the commands>

    '+' marks the default job. '-' marks the next default one. That is to say, if you use bg or fg command while no argument is appended, then the job with '+' will be the object of the command.

    For example, you can obtain a job list using " jobs " like this:

         [1]     running		sleep 100 &
         [2]-    running		sleep 300 &
         [3]+    stopped		sleep 200

    If there are not any background commands, then nothing will be displayed.

    If output is redirected, then the procedure will write the result into the designated destination. 

    For example, " jobs | wc -w ", " jobs > a.txt ", " jobs >> b.txt " are all supported.
