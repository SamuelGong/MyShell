    <variable>=<variable/value>+<variable/value>

    Do the simple addition in the assignment statement.

    For example, you will get $i = 1 after executing the following commands:

    i=0
    i=$i+1

    Locational variables, local shell variables and environment variables are also supported.

    For example, you can use $0, $1, ..., $9, $$, $@, $#, $?, $!, $*, $a (assume that it is one of the local shell variables), $HOME ...
